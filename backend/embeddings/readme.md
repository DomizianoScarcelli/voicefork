# Embeddings service

How to make this service work:

Just download the `large.index` file from the Google Drive folder, and put it inside of `embeddings/app/data`. Remember that it will take a little bit of time for the service to start.

Then make sure that you import the new database (guide in the `restaurants/readme.md`)

Regarding the .env files, you just have to copy the content in the .env.template and replace it with your credentials.
