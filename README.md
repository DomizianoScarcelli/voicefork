Final project for the master's degree in Computer Science course "Cloud Computing" at the University of Rome "La Sapienza" (A.Y. 2022-2023).

The project is a [TheFork](https://www.thefork.it/) mobile app clone whose backend is implemented using a microservices structure.

The app was developed using React Native, the microservices using both Express and FastAPI.

The project has been also deployed on AWS, and the infrastructure is defined using [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform), and it's load tested using [k6](https://k6.io/)
